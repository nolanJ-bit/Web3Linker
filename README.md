# Web3Linker

A decentralized profile builder for the Web3 world 🌐  

Web3Linker lets users create a simple, **wallet-verified profile** with their links, social accounts, and featured NFTs — stored securely on **IPFS** and verified via **blockchain signatures**.


## 🚀 Features

2. Fill in your profile details and add your social links.
3. Sign your data — the signature confirms your identity.
4. Your data is uploaded to IPFS and retrievable by anyone via your wallet address.

## 🌌 Vision

Web3Linker aims to be more than just a Linktree alternative —
it’s a step toward **a unified, verifiable Web3 identity layer**, owned by users, not platforms.
